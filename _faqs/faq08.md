question: "What are the physical symptoms of too much screen time? 👀💪"
order: 8
---

Physical symptoms of excessive screen time include eye strain and dry eyes, headaches and migraines, neck and shoulder pain from poor posture ('tech neck'), disrupted sleep patterns, increased risk of obesity from sedentary behavior, repetitive strain injuries in hands and wrists, and weakened immune function from chronic stress and poor sleep. Some individuals also experience digestive issues from irregular eating patterns and vitamin D deficiency from lack of outdoor activity. These symptoms often improve relatively quickly once screen time is reduced and healthy habits are established. 🏥⚡
