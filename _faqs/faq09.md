Parents can help by establishing clear, consistent digital boundaries and family rules about device use, creating tech-free zones and times (especially bedrooms and meals), modeling healthy digital behavior themselves, providing engaging offline activities and alternatives, having open conversations about digital wellness and online experiences, using parental controls and monitoring apps appropriately for the child's age, encouraging face-to-face social activities and outdoor time, and seeking professional help if the child shows signs of serious digital addiction such as declining grades, social withdrawal, or extreme emotional reactions to digital restrictions. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💖
