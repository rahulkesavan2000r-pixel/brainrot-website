Key behaviors that may indicate technology addiction include an inability to control use, lying to others about the frequency of use, having obsessive thoughts or cravings about technology, and experiencing withdrawal symptoms like anxiety or irritability when unable to access devices. Physical symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, sleep disruption, and neglect of personal hygiene may also occur. The behavior continues despite knowing it has negative consequences on relationships, work, or health. 🚨💔
