Technology addiction is a behavioral disorder characterized by the excessive and compulsive use of digital technologies. It is defined not by the amount of time spent online, but by a person's inability to control their usage, their continued use despite negative consequences, and the resulting distress and functional impairment in their daily life. The American Psychiatric Association recognizes various forms including online gaming, social media, internet surfing, and online shopping addictions. 📱⚠️
