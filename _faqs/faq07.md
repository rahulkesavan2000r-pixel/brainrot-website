Recovery timelines vary significantly based on the severity of addiction, individual circumstances, and commitment to change. Most people notice initial improvements in sleep quality and anxiety levels within 1-2 weeks of reducing screen time. Meaningful changes in attention span and focus typically occur within 4-6 weeks of consistent digital wellness practices. Full cognitive recovery and establishment of healthy digital habits generally takes 2-3 months of sustained effort. However, like other behavioral addictions, ongoing maintenance and mindfulness are required to prevent relapse into problematic patterns. 📈💪
