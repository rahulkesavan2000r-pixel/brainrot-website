order: 10
---

Professional help should be considered when digital use significantly interferes with daily functioning, relationships, work, or school performance despite multiple attempts at self-regulation. Specific indicators include experiencing severe anxiety or depression when unable to access devices, lying about or hiding the extent of digital use, neglecting basic self-care or responsibilities, having thoughts of self-harm related to online experiences, showing signs of other mental health conditions like anxiety or depression that may be exacerbated by digital use, or when family relationships are severely strained by digital behavior. Mental health professionals specializing in behavioral addictions can provide personalized treatment plans and support. 🏥💚
